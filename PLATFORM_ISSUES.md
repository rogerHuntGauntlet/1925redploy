# Platform Issues Report

## Security Issues

1. Environment Variables
   - `.env.local` contains exposed Supabase credentials in the repository
   - Placeholder API keys are committed to version control
   - Missing proper environment variable validation

2. Authentication
   - Debug email address hardcoded in `app/auth/page.tsx`
   - Missing rate limiting on authentication attempts
   - HCaptcha implementation present but keys are placeholder values

## Configuration Issues

1. Stripe Integration
   - Placeholder Stripe keys in environment configuration
   - Missing proper error handling for failed payments
   - Production keys potentially exposed in configuration

2. Solana Integration
   - Hardcoded token mint address
   - Missing fallback RPC endpoints
   - Token balance requirement hardcoded

## Implementation Issues

1. Direct Messaging
   - No message encryption for private messages
   - Missing typing indicators
   - No offline message queueing
   - No message delivery confirmation

2. Real-time Features
   - No reconnection strategy in Supabase real-time subscriptions
   - Missing error handling for failed real-time connections
   - No offline state management

3. Performance Concerns
   - Large message history loads all at once
   - No pagination implementation in direct messages
   - Missing message virtualization for large chat histories

## User Experience

1. Authentication Flow
   - No proper password strength indicator
   - Missing email verification requirement
   - OAuth providers configured but potentially not fully implemented

2. Error Handling
   - Generic error messages in many places
   - Missing proper error boundaries
   - Incomplete error state UI

## Development Setup

1. Configuration Management
   - Multiple configuration files with duplicated values
   - Missing proper TypeScript types for configuration
   - Inconsistent environment variable naming

## Recommendations

1. Security
   - Move all sensitive credentials to secure environment variables
   - Implement proper rate limiting
   - Add proper encryption for sensitive data

2. Performance
   - Implement pagination for message loading
   - Add message virtualization
   - Optimize real-time connections

3. User Experience
   - Add proper loading states
   - Implement proper error messages
   - Add typing indicators and message delivery confirmations

4. Development
   - Add proper documentation
   - Implement consistent error handling
   - Add proper testing setup

Note: This is a non-exhaustive list based on initial code review. Further testing and security audits are recommended for a complete assessment.
