# AgentEvaluationResponse Component Improvements Checklist

## 1. Loading States Implementation
- [x] Add `isLoading` prop to component
- [x] Create loading skeleton UI for sections
- [x] Add loading state for follow-up question submission
- [x] Implement loading indicators for section expansion/collapse
- [x] Add smooth transitions for loading states

## 2. Keyboard Navigation
- [x] Add keyboard support for section toggling (Enter/Space)
- [x] Implement arrow key navigation between sections
- [x] Add focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- [x] Implement tab order management
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [x] Add focus trap for follow-up question form when active

## 3. Accessibility Improvements
- [x] Add aria-expanded state for collapsible sections
- [x] Implement aria-controls for section relationships
- [x] Add descriptive aria-labels for interactive elements
- [x] Implement aria-live regions for dynamic content
- [x] Add role attributes where necessary
- [x] Ensure proper heading hierarchy
- [x] Add screen reader announcements for state changes

## 4. Error Handling
- [x] Add error boundary for component
- [x] Implement validation for evaluation string format
- [x] Add graceful fallback for malformed sections
- [x] Create error state UI components
- [x] Add error messages for common failure cases
- [x] Implement retry mechanism for failed operations

## 5. Performance Optimization
- [x] Memoize section parsing logic using useMemo
- [x] Implement virtualization for large section lists
- [x] Add debouncing for section toggling
- [x] Optimize re-renders using React.memo where appropriate
- [x] Add performance monitoring
- [x] Implement lazy loading for icons

## Implementation Order
1. Error Handling (Priority: High)
   - Essential for component stability
   - Prevents crashes from malformed data

2. Accessibility (Priority: High)
   - Critical for usability
   - Required for compliance

3. Loading States (Priority: Medium)
   - Improves user experience
   - Provides feedback during operations

4. Keyboard Navigation (Priority: Medium)
   - Enhances accessibility
   - Improves power user experience

5. Performance Optimization (Priority: Low)
   - Can be implemented incrementally
   - Important for scaling

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for section parsing
- [ ] Integration tests for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Accessibility tests (using jest-axe)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Error handling tests
- [ ] Loading state tests

## Documentation Updates Needed
- [ ] Update component props documentation
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts guide
- [ ] Document error states and handling
- [ ] Add accessibility compliance notes
- [ ] Include performance considerations
- [ ] Update usage examples
